## Usage

The updated todo list will be printed after every operation. All commands have a shorter alias that can be used as shown in the help message (for example the alias for ```add``` is ```a```).

To add an item:
```
rusty-todo add "This is a new task"
```

To list the tasks in the todo-list:
```
rusty-todo ls

Todo list : 
-----------
[1] ->      This is a test
```

There are 5 (from 1 to 5, 1 being highest priority) priority level that can be changed for each task. To change a task priority by using the task number (first input is task number, second input is priority level):
```
rusty-todo p 1 1

Todo list : 
-----------
[1] -> (!!) This is a test
```

Remove an item by using the task number:
```
rusty-todo remove 1
```

Mark an item as done by using the task number:
```
rusty-todo done 1
```

Undo a done item and reinsert in the todo list:
```
rusty-todo undo 1
```

List all the list of done tasks:
```
rusty-todo list-done
```

List both the todo list and done list:
```
rusty-todo list-all

Todo list : 
-----------
[1] ->      This is a test

Done list : 
-----------
[1] -> [2023-04-05] -      This is a done task
```

Clear (remove) all tasks in the todo (or done) list:
```
rusty-todo clear
rusty-todo clear-done
```

Add a new task at a specific number (instead of adding to the end of the list):
```
rusty-todo insert 2 "Inserting at the second position in the list"
```
